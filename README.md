# Insta Feeds

> Display Instagram Posts on your website with ease. 

This addon make's use of the [Instagram Page Display API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/) for fetching data via Instagram. 

## Features

- Provides you a tag which you use to render instagram posts in your template.
- Refresh the access token via schedular so you always keep fetching the latest content.
- Caching of the API response for faster rendering.


## How to Install

You can search for this addon in the `Tools > Addons` section of the Statamic control panel and click **install**, or run the following command from your project root:

``` bash
composer require aniket-magadum/insta-feeds
```

## How to Use

Once the extension is installed we have to setup the ```INSTA_FEEDS_ACCESS_TOKEN``` and ```INSTA_FEEDS_CLIENT_SECRET``` in your .env file.

```bash
INSTA_FEEDS_ACCESS_TOKEN=ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
INSTA_FEEDS_CLIENT_SECRET=CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
```

In order to generate these tokens you can visit this [Get Started Guide for Instagram Basic Display API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started)

On the same page you have to create a long lived access token as below

Once you click on generate token button it will ask your instagram details and once done you will receive this access token.

### Schedular

This addon requires the schedular to be running as it performs the following tasks to be run in the background.

- Caching of instagram posts for faster retrieval.
- Refreshing of the access token periodically so that we dont need to put in any manual efforts.

You can setup a schedular is not already running by [Following the Laravel Documenation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scheduling#running-the-scheduler)


### Rendering the feeds

In order to render the feeds on the frontend we can make use of the {{ insta_feed }} tag . Here is an example snipped which you can use.

```html
{{ insta_feed limit="8"}}
  <div class="mx-auto" style="margin-top: 30px;border: 2px solid black;">
     <img src="{{ media_url }}" alt="{{ caption }}" style="height: 300px ;width: 300px;">
     <p class="text-center"> {{ caption ?? 'No Caption Needed' }}</p>
  </div>
{{ /insta_feed }}
```
